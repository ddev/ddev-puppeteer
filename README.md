# ddev-puppeteer

Simple Puppeteer script for measuring DDEV performance.

This tries to use a DDEV Drupal 11 project as a measure of performance using a web install of the `demo_umami` profile.

* To use this, you need Node.js, `npm init && npm i puppeteer async`.
* On Apple Silicon, use [this article](https://www.broddin.be/fixing-the-chromium-binary-is-not-available-for-arm64/) to install arm64 chromium.
* The project named in `ddev-puppeteer.js` should be a standard Drupal 11 install as per the [DDEV Drupal 11 quickstart](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/quickstart/#drupal)
* Edit `site` and `sitedir` in `ddev-puppeteer.js`.
* Set up the project with Mutagen or Colima or whatever permutation you like.
* The project should already be running.
* Run the test with `node ddev-puppeteer.js`.

## Notes

* This is using the Drupal `demo_umami` profile, which takes longer than `standard`.
* The script resets php-fpm at the beginning to make sure we start without a PHP OPcache. This may or may not be fair.
* To see whatâ€™s happening in the install you can change `puppeteer.launch({headless: true})` to `puppeteer.launch({headless: false})`.
* The Drush install  is `ddev mysql -e "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db; CREATE DATABASE db;" && ddev exec killall -USR2 php-fpm && rm -rf web/sites/default/files/* && ddev mutagen sync && time ddev drush si demo_umami -y`
